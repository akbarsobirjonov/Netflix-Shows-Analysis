# 🎬 Netflix Shows Analysis

📊 A simple exploratory data analysis of Netflix’s content using Python and pandas, including visualizations of genres, release years, and countries.

This project contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations based on the [Netflix Shows Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows) from Kaggle.

## 📊 Summary of Analysis

In this notebook, we performed EDA to understand the distribution and characteristics of Netflix content. Here's what we did:

- 📥 **Loaded the dataset** and inspected its structure using `.info()`, `.head()`, and `.describe()`.
- 🧹 **Cleaned the data** by handling missing values in the `director`, `cast`, and `country` columns and converting the `date_added` column to datetime format.
- 📅 **Analyzed content trends** over time based on release years and added dates.
- 🌍 **Explored content origins** by visualizing data by country and region.
- 🎭 **Broke down genres and types** (TV Shows vs Movies) and identified the most common categories.
- 📈 **Created visualizations** using libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
